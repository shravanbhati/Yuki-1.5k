# Yuki 1.5K

Yuki 1.5K is a modern Japanese vocabulary deck for Anki, created to give beginners a smooth and clean learning experience.  
It is based on the original [Kaishi 1.5K](https://github.com/donkuri/kaishi) deck and keeps the same content while adding a better UI and extra features.  
This page explains everything about the deck.

## About Images

This deck does not include any of the original images from Kaishi 1.5K.  
I personally believe that images do not help much in learning vocabulary.  
If you want to see related images, click on the **Image** button on the card. It will open Google Images for that word.



## Hint Feature

You can add your own hint to the front of any card.  
The hint stays hidden until you click on it.  

To add one:
1. While reviewing, click the three dots.
2. Select **Edit Card**.
3. Add your text or image inside the **Hint** field.

- Pitch accent  
- Pitch accent note  
- Frequency  
- Card buttons

**Book button** – Opens the word in Jisho dictionary  
**Image button** – Opens Google Images for the word  
**Report button** – Opens a Google Form to send feedback or report a bug  



## Compatibility

You can apply Yuki 1.5K styling to your existing Kaishi 1.5K deck without losing progress.  
A short guide on this will be added soon.
